# Genetic_Algorithm
The purpose ofthis project is to verify the ability of a genetic algorithm library tosolve complex combinatorial problems. I will analyze an application I developedfor finding the parameters of a linear, polynomial and sinus equation. The goalis to achieve the best possible fit to a function generated from experimentaldata. The entire process of creating the application in the python programminglanguage based on open source libraries PyGAD, PySimpleGUI and others.
In the future I want expoand app capabilities to compute more complex equations like Bouc-Wen model, which is second order nonlinear partial differential equations.
